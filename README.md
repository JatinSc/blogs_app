## Blogs App - Documentation

## Introduction
The Blogs App is a web application that allows users to create and manage blog posts. The app is built using Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and Sequelize. Users can register, log in, and perform CRUD operations on their blog posts.

## Getting Started Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/JatinSc/blogs_app.git` 

## Navigate to the project directory:
`cd blogs_app/frontend and backend `

## Install dependencies:
`npm install`

## Start the development server:
`npm start`

## Open your web browser and access the app at http://localhost:3000/.


# Development Process

## Planning and Design:
Define the project requirements, features, and user stories.
Design the database schema, including tables for users and posts with appropriate relationships.

## Backend Development:
Set up the Node.js and Express.js server.
Connect to the MySQL database using Sequelize.
Implement user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Create RESTful API endpoints for user registration, login, and CRUD operations for blog posts.

## Frontend Development:
Set up the React.js project using npm create vite@latest.
Create components for the home page, login, registration, and blog post management.
Implement user interface functionalities for user registration, login, and blog post management.

## Database and Data Validation:
Implement data validation for user input to prevent malicious data.
Add validation on the backend for user authentication and blog post operations.

## State Management:
Use React's Context API state management of user.
Manage user authentication status and user information using state management.

## Styling and CSS:
Style the application using CSS and/or CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.
Design a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
Testing:


# Deployment:
connect the backend to a remote server or cloud service (e.g., console clever.cloud).
Deploy the frontend and backend on a static file hosting service (e.g., render).

### Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup:
Clone the backend repository from GitHub.
Install Node.js and npm if not already installed.
Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
Set up a MySQL database and update the database connection details in the Sequelize configuration file (config/config.js).
Run Sequelize migrations and seeders to create the necessary tables and initial data (if any).
Create a .env file and set the necessary environment variables (e.g., JWT secret key).
Start the backend server using npm start.

### Frontend Setup:
Clone the frontend repository from GitHub.
Install Node.js and npm if not already installed.
Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
Update the API endpoint URL to point to the backend server in the frontend code.
Start the frontend development server using npm start.

### Important Design Decisions
MySQL and Sequelize:
Chose MySQL as the relational database for its data integrity features.
Used Sequelize as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to simplify database operations and manage database models in a JavaScript-friendly way.
User Authentication:

### Implemented user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely manage user sessions.

## RESTful API:
Designed the backend API to follow RESTful principles for a clean and standardized API structure.
Database Schema:
Created a relational database schema with tables for users and posts, establishing a foreign key relationship between them.

### State Management:
Utilized React's Context APIfor efficient state management and to share user authentication status and user information across components.

### Validation:
Implemented data validation on both the frontend and backend to ensure the integrity and security of user input.

### Responsive Design:
Designed the user interface to be responsive and work seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes.

### Error Handling:
Implemented robust error handling on both the frontend and backend to provide meaningful error messages to users.
